🚀 I've recently completed a fascinating Power BI project where I utilized a dataset from Kaggle, specifically focusing on Amazon Prime Movies and TV Shows. In this project, I've created a compelling Power BI report and dashboard, which you can explore through the provided links. Using Power Query and various Power BI techniques, I've analyzed and visualized the dataset to unearth interesting insights about Amazon Prime's content.

📊 You can access the dataset on Kaggle here: Kaggle Dataset and on GitHub here: GitHub Dataset.

🎨 I also incorporated the Amazon Prime logo into the dashboard design, which you can find here: Logo.

🤩 If you're interested in Power BI, data analysis, or Amazon Prime content, feel free to explore my project and let me know your thoughts. It's a great example of how Power BI can be used to extract valuable insights from real-world data. Enjoy the journey! 😊📈📺🔍
